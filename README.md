# Notebook Line of Code Calculator

This Python script is designed to calculate the total lines of code (LOC) and total lines of markdown text in a Jupyter notebook file. By leveraging the nbformat library, the script parses the notebook's content and extracts the code and markdown cells for analysis.

### Features:

1. Analyzes Jupyter notebook files to determine the distribution of code and markdown text.
2. Provides a quick overview of the notebook's structure and content.
3. Useful for assessing the size and complexity of notebooks with significant code and markdown sections.
4. Calculates the total number of lines of code and markdown, aiding in understanding the overall content volume.

### How to Use:

1. Install the required libraries (if not already installed) by running pip install nbformat.
2. Place the script in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook you want to analyze.
3. Edit the a variable to specify the path to the notebook file.
4. Execute the script, and it will display the total lines of code and markdown in the notebook.

Feel free to use this tool to gain insights into the structure and content distribution of your Jupyter notebooks. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or contribute to the project! Happy analyzing!
